		"text": "Author of Issues in Hands-on Online Graduate Programs in Information Technology, <i>There is a high demand for online graduate programs in various engineering and technology fields. The reasoning is simple: there is a large pool of working professionals needing graduate study, but cannot afford to in-person due to their job, family, or distance limitations. The Department of Technology Systems, within the College of Technology and Computer Science (TECS) at East Carolina University has been offering several Internet-based graduate programs since 1995. This paper focuses on the Master of Science in Industrial Technology (MSIT) that has several concentrations, including Computer Networking Management, Digital Communications, and Information Security. All courses in the MSIT program are delivered 100% online, with majority of the technical courses having lab- intensive, hands-on components. This paper sha res information pertaining to some of the issues and experiences of offering graduate, hands-on programs in information technology (IT) completely online."
